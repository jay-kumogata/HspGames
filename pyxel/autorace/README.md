# Autorace

## Introduction

I ported Miss Harumi Takahasi's [Autorace(1 screen software)](https://archive.org/details/Fm-7Fm-8/page/n173/mode/2up) to Pyxel/Python. 
The original was published in [FM-7 FM-8 Harumi's Game Library](https://archive.org/details/Fm-7Fm-8/).
This is a game where you operate your car and avoid obstacles.
It is extremely difficult.
