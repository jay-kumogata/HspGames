# Eating sheep program

## Introduction

I ported the "Eating sheep program" introduced 
in a book ["Math Adventures with Python"](https://nostarch.com/mathadventures) to Pyxel. 
It is a simulation of sheep moving while eating grass. 
When there is no more grass to eat, they will be taken to heaven.
