## How to Run

Please execute the following from the Pyxel (version 1.7.1) environment.

	> python Nixie.py

## Remarks

I started making Nixie tube clocks with Pyxel. 
First, I drew a dot picture of a Nixie tube, but it looks like a toy. 
I had an LED calculator that runs an LED check (count up) when the power is turned off and on, but I remembered that. 
It is delicate whether to make this continuation.
