    > python Asteroids.py

## How to Play

You rotate your ship with [Left] and [Right] keys,
and shoot a bullet with [Space] key and split the meteorite.
Small meteorites are extinguished. 
If you hit a meteorite, the game is over. 
You can replay with [Enter] key.
If you split the meteorite, you will get 100 points, 
and if you eliminate it, you will get 500 points.
