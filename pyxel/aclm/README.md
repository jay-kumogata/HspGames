# ACLM

## Introduction

I ported Mr. Wingman's [ACLM](https://archive.org/details/micom-basic-magazine-issue-16-october-1983/page/n92/mode/1up) to Pyxel/Python. 
The original was published in [Mycom Basic Magazine (October 1983 issue)](https://archive.org/details/micom-basic-magazine-issue-16-october-1983/). 
This is a game where you operate my aircraft (red) and defeat enemy aircraft (blue) by hitting them vertically and horizontally. 
Since it is extremely difficult, I have changed the rules to say that if my aircraft collides with the enemy aircraft, it will be 'a tie' instead of 'a loss.' 
Also, the original version seems to have a scene 2 in which they attack a city.
