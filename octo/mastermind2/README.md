# Mastermind (5 row) for CHIP-8

## Introduction

## Revisions

### Ver. 1

I also reprinted the 5 row mastermind in octo assembly language. 
I manually typed in the source of the 5 row mastermind published in a magazine called Viper (Volume 1, Issue 7, pp.22-26). 
In the low resolution mode (64x32), the screen collapsed due to lack of pixels, so I am using the high resolution mode (128x64).
In the 4 row version, the number of figures has increased from 4 to 5, and the number has also increased from 6 (1 to 6) to 8 (0 to 7). 
Enter the figures with the [X] / [1] / [2] / [3] / [Q] / [W] / [E] / [A] keys. 
Other than that, it is the same as the 4 row version.
