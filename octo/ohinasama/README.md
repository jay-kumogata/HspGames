# Hinamatsuri for CHIP-8

Hinamatsuri, also called Doll's Day or Girl's Day, is a religious holiday in Japan 
and celebrated on 3 March of each year.
At the Hinamatsuri Ohinasama dolls are displayed to celebrate the growth of girls.

## Revisions

### Ver. 5

This is the 5th version of drawing Ohinasama with CHIP-8. 
I changed it to a pixel art style color scheme. 
Since Hinamatsuri is a festival for girls, I mainly use pink. 
The gameboy-style green color didn't suit the Ohinasama. 
The Hinamatsuri demo is nearing completion.
