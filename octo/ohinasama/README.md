## Revisions

### Ver. 5

This is the 5th version of drawing Ohinasama with CHIP-8. 
I changed it to a pixel art style color scheme. 
Since Hinamatsuri is a festival for girls, I mainly use pink. 
The gameboy-style green color didn't suit the Ohinasama. 
The Ohinasama demo is nearing completion.

### Ver. 4

This is the 4th version of drawing Ohinasama with CHIP-8. 
I drew "Hishimochi" (a symbolic Japanese sweet) and also played "Tanoshii Hinamaturi (Happy Doll's Day)" .
The tone can be changed, but I dared to use a square wave to make it look like a chiptune.
