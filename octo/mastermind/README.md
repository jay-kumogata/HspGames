## Revisions

### Ver.1

I have reprinted mastermind in octo assembly language. 
Two types of mastermind have been developed in the past, 5 row version and 4 row version. 
Here, the 4 row version of the binary is decompiled 
and the comments of the 5 row version published in the magazine Viper (Volume 1, Issue 7, pp.22-26) are added.
You can play [here](https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/index.html?key=ZcpKkcEl).
