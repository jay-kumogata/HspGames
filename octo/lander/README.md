# Lunar Lander for CHIP-8

## Introduction

Lunar Lander was also reprinted in octo assembly language. 
This is a game where you operate a lunar module and land on the moon. 
Lunar Lander (1979 / Atari) is a famous implementation, 
but the Apollo program's lunar lander simulator seems to be the original.
