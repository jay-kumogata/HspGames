# Dodge for CHIP-8

## Ver.5

As a practice of pixel art (16x16x4 colors), I drew Xevious's Andor Genesis. 
Since I drew it with much effort, I tried to make it appear in Dodge's enemy character. 
Operate Solvalou to avoid enemy characters. 
You can play [here](https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/index.html?key=mo04OUlO) 
and operate it with the A / D key or the [<-] / [->] keys.
