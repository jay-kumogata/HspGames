# Dodge for CHIP-8

## Ver. 5

As a practice of pixel art (16x16x4 colors), I drew Xevious's Andor Genesis. 
Since I drew it with much effort, I tried to make it appear in Dodge's enemy character. 
Operate Solvalou to avoid enemy characters. 
You can play [here](https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/index.html?key=mo04OUlO) 
and operate it with the [A] / [D] key or the [<-] / [->] keys.

## Ver. 4

I also changed the character of the sample game Dodge of Octojam8 to a dot picture style color scheme. 
I played the music of Namco's masterpiece Xevious. 
It may be gray in terms of rights, but please understand that it is a homage work. 
Operate Solvalou to avoid the domes and pyramids.
