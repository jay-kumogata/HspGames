# Dodge for CHIP-8

## Ver. 5

Since I drew it with much effort, I tried to make it appear in Dodge's enemy character. 
Operate Solvalou to avoid enemy characters.

## Ver. 4

I also changed the character of the sample game Dodge of [Octojam8](https://itch.io/jam/octojam-8) to a dot picture style color scheme. 
I played the music of Namco's masterpiece Xevious. 
It may be gray in terms of rights, but please understand that it is a homage work. 
Operate Solvalou to avoid the domes and pyramids.
